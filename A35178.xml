            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Know many will expect a very great Name<note n="*" place="bottom">The A. B. of <hi>Cant.</hi>
                     </note> ſhould Front this very little Piece: But is not Diſproportion a very unbecoming thing; a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Book</hi> Dedicated to a Prince? His Right is <hi>Prior,</hi> either as to Pains or Expences: If thou art a Gainer by it, the Praiſe is his due, though the Deed is a Mite among the Numerous and Eminent Acts of that Perſon. Let <hi>Proteſtants</hi> never forget his Prudence and Courage, in Confronting the Jeſuites in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign. They who know him, know how inſipid Flatteries and Complements are to him, even when his Charity is convinc'd they come from the
<pb facs="tcp:49060:3"/> Heart. But for drawing his Picture to the World; my <hi>Penſil</hi> is very unfit, and my <hi>Colours</hi> at preſent too Lifeleſs.</p>
                  <p>Two Things I would further Inculcate, though in the Book Inſiſted on; The <hi>Solidity</hi> and <hi>Gain</hi> of this Art.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Firſt:</hi> I have no Reaſon to diſtruſt the Faculties God has given me; and therefore will never reject my own Opinion for anothers, without Conviction. On the other hand, I know I am not Infallible, and therefore rejoyce that at laſt I have gotten this Piece, this Art, ſet upon the Stage of our <hi>Engliſh World;</hi> where as it will meet with Fond Embracers, and Fooliſh Rejecters, ſo will it with <hi>Sagacious, Unprejudic'd, Impartial</hi> and <hi>Skilful Judges,</hi> as any in the World. For this End have I been at this unſeaſonable Pains; For this End have my Noble Benefactors been at the Charges; that if it be an Impoſtor, it may die as a Criminal, and the World be undeceived: But if it be a <hi>Light from Heaven,</hi> we may not be Fighters againſt God, and rejecters of our own Mercy.</p>
                  <p>He that would either Attack it as an Enemy, or endeavour Satisfaction about it, as a Diſciple, muſt firſt and principally enquire, If this be a real Art, or a Fiction; If the ends pretended by theſe Rules, be as really gain'd, as the making <hi>Verſe</hi> by <hi>Proſodia, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> by the <hi>Syntax,</hi> and <hi>Analyſis</hi> by <hi>Rules of Logick.</hi> Now all that I require of thee is, That thou be a good Proficient, a Maſter of the Art, not a Scholar in it, before thou undertake to Judge. A Boy cannot pierce <hi>Corderius</hi> by his <hi>Grammar;</hi> but the defect is in the
<pb facs="tcp:49060:3"/> Boy, not in the <hi>Grammar.</hi> I had ſtill ſome Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about this Point, until I found out the <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Uſe</hi> (I mean that uſe of knowing the Author's Intentions, which bears an <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> and ſo I call it the <hi>Rhetorical Uſe</hi>) I found ſo many Exceptions, but now I know not if there are any. Are ever Words ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Senſe, where a Miniſter joyns? Are ever <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap> to be found in the Logical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, where Propoſitions are not diſtinguiſhed? Is ever <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be found in a Verſe of one Propoſition? But when its made two, by repeating the Verb, the very Harmony of Truth, with fulneſs and ſweetneſs, Charms the <hi>Reader</hi> into an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: As far as my Eyes can yet ſee, the Reader muſt embrace this for an <hi>Art,</hi> a <hi>Grammar</hi> about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Points, as the <hi>Latine, Hebrew, Greek Grammar</hi> about Twenty Two, or Twenty Four ſeveral Letters, but with a Fulneſs and Exactneſs beyond them; ſo that it ſeems to comprehend <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> alſo. But though <hi>Grammar, Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> are of Affinity, yet diſtinct Arts, ſo this is diſtinct from all the Three, in its Matter, Points, its End, the Senſe and Intention of the Author, its Means or Rules; it ſuppoſes thy Skill in Grammatical Syntax, and begins with that. Now I am glad it comes on the Stage with perfection of Parts, by which it is ſo eaſily able to diſpell all Miſts of Obſcurity, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all Objections againſt it. One may more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably deny all Arts, than own them, and deny this to be one.</p>
                  <p>But ſome <hi>Ignoramus</hi> may ſay, Did not <hi>Capellus, Elias Levita, B. Walton, Voſſius, Magna Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> deny them to be an Art for this end?</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49060:4"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> I wiſh thou knew what theſe Men ſaid, that thou may not be guilty of the Abſurdity I have found in them, whom themſelves, and this City, count great. I thank you Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſays one, for your Pains againſt <hi>Capellus,</hi> he deſerves more Satyr. But within a few Days, ſays the ſame, the <hi>Hebrew Bibles</hi> differs ſo much from one another, that no Rules can agree to them. <hi>Capellus</hi> would have ſpit in the Man's face, that durſt affront our <hi>Sacred Originals,</hi> at any ſuch rate.</p>
                  <p>I am glad, ſays a Second, you bring down <hi>Voſſius</hi> a little, he is a proud, ſaucy Author, on which I ſent one to ſee if he would Incourage by <hi>Subſcription.</hi> No, ſays he, the <hi>Seventy</hi> is my Original. I pray what would <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſay to this Man? I never denied, ſays he, That the beſt of the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s had <hi>20000</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in him. Where is now the Perfection of our Rule of Faith? Where is now Scrupulous Nonconformity with theſe Men, if this be their Opinion of their Bibles, that they neither are Perfect, nor do agree in <hi>Faith, Worſhip, Life</hi> or <hi>Government?</hi> for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> does not with the one, and the <hi>Greek</hi> does not, as all conſent, with the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R. 2.</hi> Theſe great Names never denied that theſe Points contain'd an Art.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R. 3.</hi> They never denied that they contain'd this Art in them, for they dreamt not of it; it was not ſtarted to them, or by them. Its like this Proſpect had allur'd theſe <hi>Magna Nomina</hi> to be Patrons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Enemies in this Point they never were. Thou muſt begin, or ſome body elſe, for none yet have, to Oppoſe it.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49060:4"/>
                  <p>But though this Edition of this Art appears with greater Maturity, and Adultneſs than others, it is far from a Perfection of Beauty: Never did Book more want Apology, never was more Apology to be made: It is ſo far from Embelliſhment, with the Trappings and Phalera's of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Eloquence,</hi> that it comes forth with a Stile <hi>Difficile, Laconick, Curt,</hi> and <hi>Abrupt;</hi> it wears a Rent, inſtead of a Girdle, and Baldneſs for Beauty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> Though the Art has coſt me many Years Studies and Collections, the time of Compoſing it, as now Publiſh'd, has been a time of ſevere Sickneſs; all the Time I have kept my Chamber, and moſt of it my Bed. Soul and Body bear a powerful Sympathy: ſo it is a ſickly Stile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If it pleaſe God to reſtore Health, I ſhall endeavour to mend it: I daily expect Improvements from <hi>Roſtoch, Waſmuth Junior</hi> of <hi>Lipſic,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gordon,</hi> Profeſſor (or to be) of this Art in <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> But he informed me, the <hi>Rhetorical Uſe</hi> is entirely unknown to thoſe Parts. But it is fit to ſee firſt, what Acceptance theſe Rudiments find.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Reader,</hi> having now made Apology for my Stile, or defect of one, and ſet before thee, in clear Light, comparing it with the Book, that it is to deny Demonſtration, nay, Matter of Fact, to deny that theſe Points were Contriv'd intentionally, in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Conſtitution they ſtand in (every Word bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Point, whoſe Figure Indicates the relation it has to the next Word only, if a Miniſter, or little Lord, to it, and more, if a greater Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to
<pb facs="tcp:49060:5"/> aſſiſt the <hi>Reader</hi> to know the Senſe of every Verſe, by Indicating the relation of all the Words and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. And to deny, that theſe Tables and Rules do Indicate theſe Relations, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may be ſecure of the Author's Intention, may as well deny the <hi>Grammatical Harmony</hi> of <hi>Claſſical Authors,</hi> or the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Grammar</hi> to Indicate them. The next thing is to Enquire who is the Author of this Art, or theſe Points that contain it? This indeed has been contended among great Names, but never ſince, or where the Senſe of the Bible was own'd to be the end of the Art. It was no wonder a wiſe Man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that to be the Fruit of Divine Wiſdom, that thirty ſeveral Figures ſhould be invented to inform us, if the Accent was on the laſt Syllable, or that before it, when the Poſition of one was ſufficient; but ſo high an end as the Author's Intention, through ſo harmonious a Chain of Means, might have charm'd them into a Belief of it. For who can know the Mind of the Lord but his Spirit? And who can ſet Rules to know what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Diſpute has been about the Vowels; theſe great Names when preſs'd with Arguments, have own'd that the Accentual were before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suppoſe that was their Opinion, That the <hi>Tyberian Maſorites</hi> were Authors of all the Points, there is reaſon ſince thou imbrace it on their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou ſhould take all their Authority together, and then thou will believe them the beſt Artiſts of the World, nay, Divinely Inſpired, ſays <hi>Levita,</hi> thou may expect a great Expoſition, but yeſterdays Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is too mean; and if thou go beyond them, thou
<pb facs="tcp:49060:5"/> wilt, I doubt, find as little of their Greatneſs, as of the wiſe Men of <hi>Gotam</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To come to earneſt: Two things I think may demonſtrate, the <hi>Tyberians</hi> not to be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: Theſe <hi>Tyberian Schools</hi> continued until <hi>Ann. 1000.</hi> and yet we have no Footſteps of its Skill and Practice among them, an entire Silence ſtill, as the Night, for that five hundred Years, and ever ſince, except what they bring by Quotation from more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors; but the Authors before the <hi>Tyberians</hi> do.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this with a Providential Story known to my Friends. I once Preaching on <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.4. Tranſlated it thus. <hi>Theſe are the Generations of the Heaven and the Earth, when God had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. Theſe are the Generations of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the Earth, in the Day when God had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, re-made, or eſtabliſhed them.</hi> From which I inferr'd, a two-fold Re-capitulation to be contain'd in the Verſe, one perform'd within the time of firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the <hi>Six Days,</hi> the other perform'd in <hi>one Day;</hi> the one was a pure Creative Work, the other a more Common, Adorning, Perfecting, or doing further. <hi>Moſes</hi> had more ſignaliz'd that one Day and Work in it, in the <hi>Context,</hi> and from <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.8. to the end, whereby it appeared evident, That the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was the Foundation of the <hi>Seventh-Day-Sabbath.</hi> An Ancient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian hearing me, ask'd if I had read Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> a Divine in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, who has Printed, That <hi>Adam</hi> fell on <hi>Friday,</hi> the ſame Day our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffer'd; That He endur'd the Curſe of the Law, that Night, that <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8. in
<pb facs="tcp:49060:6"/> the Morning of <hi>Saturday,</hi> God appear'd in Humane Form, and gave that New Goſpel Conſtitution. So that all the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is but a <hi>Comment</hi> on the <hi>Seventh Day</hi>'s Work, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8. to the end of that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Having obtain'd this Old and Rare Book, and after that <hi>Jacob Alting,</hi> on the ſame Subject, I found an Entire Agreement, as to the Doctrine, but not as to the Original; my Points had forced me into it, but the <hi>Old Cabbaliſtical Jews</hi> had enticed them into it. The Inferencce I draw, is, That the <hi>Evangelical Doctrines</hi> contain'd in theſe <hi>Old Jewiſh Kabbala</hi>'s, were Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines retain'd ſince the Points were loſt, but known from and by them; and I think it is the moſt Rational Account of that <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> I am ſure it is more becoming than to call all the <hi>Laborious Pains</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtian Fathers,</hi> in theſe <hi>Rabbies,</hi> Forgeries, Lies and Cheats, before we try too, by our Pains, if ſo, or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is not only true, but there is much <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe made of theſe <hi>Points</hi> before the <hi>Maſorites,</hi> of five or ſix Hundred, and no uſe made by them, but their Work ſhows them really Ignorant of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, as may be ſeen in the Book.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Tyberians</hi> were poor blinded <hi>Jews,</hi> and their <hi>Creed</hi> the ſame with our <hi>Jews,</hi> and their own Fathers directly Oppoſite to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith:</hi> but the Authors of the <hi>Points,</hi> as may be ſeen by the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Prophetick Places</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> Expounded by the <hi>Points,</hi> were truly and thorowly <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> ſo that to ſay they invented this, is
<pb facs="tcp:49060:6"/> to deny them to be <hi>Jews,</hi> which no Man ever yet did. And I take this for Demonſtration, That they would never deliver the Senſe of their <hi>Bibles</hi> to be contradictory or deſtructive to themſelves: Therefore at leaſt, the Senſe of the Scripture given by theſe <hi>Points,</hi> is of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Authority, a <hi>Comment</hi> by <hi>Ezra, Haggai, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah,</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> with others of that day.</p>
                  <p>Some may think this was over-order'd by <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> as their preſerving the reſt of the Parts of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> entire, without Corruption, though againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> That is what I yield, a Providence in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that ſuppoſes their Pre-exiſtence, but to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any <hi>Jews,</hi> ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> invented theſe Points, and affixed them, as giving the Senſe of the <hi>Bible,</hi> is not only a Miracle, but a Contradiction; for it is their Reaſon, and not their Reaſon, that their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was both <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> at the ſame time. For Inſtance, it was and is (<hi>Paul</hi> Atteſts it) their moſt Radicated Judgment, that they expected to be Sav'd by the Works their Law Commanded, but if they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd theſe Points to that place in <hi>Hab.</hi> with a deſign to give its Senſe in their Judgment; They tell you, that their Judgment is, <hi>That he who is Juſt, or Righteous by Faith, ſhall live, he ſhall never taſte of the Curſe of Death, but ever drink the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Life.</hi> None of them ever pretended an Opinion oppoſite to what they believed was the <hi>Bible</hi>'s Senſe; yet whenever they give their Opinion in other Writings, it is oppoſite. So if Authors of this Art, in place of an over-ruling Providence, we plant a Repugnancy as Abſurd as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in their minds.</p>
                  <p>For we Aſſert them to be Orthodox in Pointing, tho
<pb facs="tcp:49060:7"/> Erronious in their Judgment, and yet this Pointing is a Declaring their Judgment.</p>
                  <p>The Prophets wrote what they underſtood not, may be what was contrary to their preſent Sentiment, but then it is ſuppoſed they knew not what they wrote, but theſe <hi>Maſorites</hi> were Directors of the Senſe; for if it ſhould be ſaid, at that Juncture, they were blinded, or over-ruled by Divine Influence, it would follow God was Author, not they, and then the Queſtion is gain'd. For to ſay they were the Pointers, is to ſay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that to be the Senſe of the Text, which the Rules guides us in, and that which they then believ'd, and believ'd not. I have the more largely inſiſted on this, becauſe it was Objected by a Perſon of worth.</p>
                  <p>Let me tell him that is a little acquainted with, and exerciſed in the <hi>Hebrew Language,</hi> that the <hi>Bible</hi> needs ſuch a Key to determine its Senſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the next, the Gain, I dare aver, He that counts the furniſhing his Head and his Heart with Divine Truth Gain; that values <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, will ſoon gain more than the <hi>India</hi>'s can afford. But Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons are moſt proper among things of a kind; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aſſert, Thou ſhalt find as great a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and other methods of <hi>Comments</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems,</hi> as between Reaping and Gleaning. But this I ſpeak to grown underſtanding Chriſtians and Miniſters. <hi>Comments,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Criticks,</hi> are neceſſary; it is a Contempt of God, who has been pleas'd to continue his Oracles in theſe Tongues, not to Study them, as far as our Callings and Neceſſities admit. God gave theſe Tongues to all the Gifted Brethren we read of in Scripture; certainly his Scholars are the beſt; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Excellency that marks his Diſciples, and
<pb facs="tcp:49060:7"/> yet I do not think it an Eſſential, where God has made other uſeful Induements ſhine, as <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim.</hi> I ſhould be far from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable Thoughts of his Calling; but he is unfit to expound Scripture: We have <hi>Euſebius, Joſephus,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but no Man knows when he reads Truth, or when Falſhood, when he reads them. There are many Tranſlations, he knows not which to prefer, how ſhall he then Expound? And yet this Man may write a Treatiſe excellently; curious Chains of Thoughts, that never enter'd into the <hi>Critick</hi>'s Mind.</p>
                  <p>I could mention a great Name for inſtance, but need not. But when thou haſt exerciſed thy ſelf in both theſe Gifts, thou here enters a Third Form, where thou may try the Solidity of theſe curious Thoughts, and where thou makeſt the Spring it ſelf thy Drink, and not only ſo, but thou enterſt this Palace with the <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> the Church was robb'd of in the <hi>Phariſees</hi> time, by which thou wilt ſpy Pearls, where others ſee nothing but Pebles. For this end I made choice of <hi>Gen. 1.1, 2.</hi> for a Specimen, a Path beaten like the Street, and yet made Diſcoveries. I challenge thee, and I dare chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any to bring me the Text, out of which I ſhall not make new Diſcoveries by it, that he ſaw not before: Thou will be a Gainer in every Verſe. If we value this Art by the Teſtimony and Judgment of Men, it is not fit; we make the Blind Judges, that underſtand it not, nor the World, <hi>that love Darkneſs more than Light.</hi> But if we value it by the Judgment either of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who either knew this Art, or tho they knew not the Art, believ'd it ſerv'd for this end, they count it the only Meaſure and Standard for Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, all other Means are very mean in their
<pb facs="tcp:49060:8"/> eſteem. But this is the <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> whoſe Loſs they bewail, though the <hi>Phariſees</hi> would not uſe it, nor ſuffer others, which its like Chriſt reſpected, when He ſaid ſuch Points ſhould not be loſt, though diſuſed. This they call Queen of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> this they call Compaſs of Tranſlations, all before were Coaſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> I propos'd the common places as a <hi>Medium,</hi> to prevent the Bulk of this Book, and its Abſtruſeneſs, for nothing Teaches like Example. But here my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is doubled: Some are ſo Curious, ſome ſo Jealous, whether theſe Points will prop their <hi>Syſtem,</hi> or not. Are they <hi>Socinian, Arminian, Amyrald. Calviniſtic, Antinomian?</hi> There are many more, <hi>Origens, Papiſts,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Curious Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of ſome School-men, in his Knowledge of God and Chriſt. There are different Rivulets of thoſe, and many more may be invented. But I have been always Jealous of meaſuring Infinite Models by Humane Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Divine Wiſdom, by the ſhort Thoughts of Man. I always had my Faith to my ſelf, and no Foundation but, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> And ſince Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, a readineſs to profeſs it. My Buſineſs is to go from place to place with this <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and to try how much of that Myſterious Wiſdom that Text contains, and how much the other, wherein we may find the Scriptures a ſufficient Perfect Canon, without School Terms. A Second is Expences: But I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture when Experience has taught how needful this Art is, as well as uſeful, and how neceſſary Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are to Inſtruct in this Art, without a Living Maſter (for nothing that is rare, precious, of great uſe, is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eaſily obtain'd) many for the publick Good, and their own, will wiſh they had born all the Charges,
<pb facs="tcp:49060:8"/> when it is not to be purchas'd. However, I adviſe thee to the beſt ſupply in its room, theſe Books who have practically and applicatory wrote on the Subject, that is <hi>Comments,</hi> who have taken meaſures from them, as <hi>Geierus, Coccejus,</hi> &amp;c. but above all <hi>Varenius,</hi> in whom thou wilt ſee at large moſt of the Examples that are but just hinted at in my Book; thou wilt find conſiderable Parts of the Bible exemplified, and in <hi>Reinbeck</hi> ſome of them apply'd to his Rules; but be ſure to uſe thy <hi>Bible</hi> in reading my Book, and if a <hi>Latine Reader</hi> only, uſe <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> if an <hi>Engliſh</hi> only, uſe <hi>Hutterus,</hi> and bring the Points on the correſpondent Words. If thou intends to taſte only, and ſatisfie Curioſity, paſs the firſt Chapter; but if a Diſciple, get it by Heart, comparing it with the firſt Table.</p>

Now it was poſſible for him that Copied out this, not to write firſt in his Book or Roll, what was firſt wrote in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. But I thought the Gentleman in great need of Arguments, that told me, his great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Scriptures Divinity was the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity he ſaw in <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> ſome Stories in a latter Chapter, 7 or 20 Years acted before what is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a former Chapter; they may bring the ſame Argument, becauſe <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is put after <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> which in time was 200 Years before; and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Books 500 Years before him, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, in moſt <hi>Hebrew</hi> Books put next to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s.

                     <p>The 3d. Argument is that which alone might give ſaticfaction, Becauſe they are harmonious means in ſerving of this end; no body could ever yet find out Rules by which they guided us in the Metre or Muſick of Scripture, though it has been ſtudied by many this 1500 Years. But I can find no Man before <hi>Bohlius,</hi> about 40 Years ago, that has dreamt of this end ſince it was loſt; and it had come to a conſiderable perfection; if too early Death had not ſnatch'd him off in his very Youth, we might have ſeen it in its <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now. Doth any Man deſire better proof for the Truth of a Grammar than this; the cuſtom of the Claſſick Authors is ſo, that by following theſe Rules we are able to expound, and make <hi>Latin</hi> ſomething like to them. In Phyſicks we require no more of Axioms than this, that we can explain the moſt difficile appearance or effect of Nature by them. Now in this Bible thou haſt at leaſt 22 Claſſick Authors (Time will, it may be, diſcover ſome other Book that has them too, if not, its an exactneſs ſhining to the Glory of this Book above others) and the Rules I ſhall give thee about theſe Points, ſhall both inſtruct thee to expound them, and make <hi>Hebrew</hi> in Syntactical order like them; and thou ſhalt have Axioms holding as univerſally without exception, as the Axioms of Phyſicks. And that I may not diſappoint, nor defer thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, I will firſt ſhow thee how harmonious the Scripture is, to admit and accept of Rules of this kind; for where the like Syntax or Sentence there are the like Points.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Axiom</hi> 1. All the Kings, in Number 22, do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſtinguiſh the Word they are under, or over, more or leſs, from the following, Except where the ſenſe is emphatical, and ſome Rhetorical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Axiome</hi> 2. Every Miniſter ſignifies, that the Word it marks is joined in ſenſe, or conſtrued with the following Word by ſome Syntactical Rules; as that of <hi>Appoſition, Regimen Genitivi,</hi> or <hi>Adjective</hi> and <hi>Subſtantive, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe Two Things they differ from other <hi>Syntaxes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the whole uſe of the <hi>Reges;</hi> for <hi>Syntaxes</hi> are only concerned about the manner of conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Words. We have no Weſtern Art about <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> except what is comprehended in a right placing of <hi>Comma</hi>'s, <hi>Colon</hi>'s and <hi>Punctum</hi>'s, which is little ſtudied.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the uſe of the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> about Seven in Number, they are not applicable to Seven Rules, or more, of our <hi>Latine Syntax,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew Grammar</hi> affords Rules of that kind, as alſo about the <hi>Idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms;</hi> wherein it differs from other Languages, but their difference ariſes from their relation to the <hi>Lords</hi> they ſerve, as may be learned by the Table.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Axiome</hi> 3. The more remote an inferiour Lord ſtands from his ſuperiour in the ſame Sentence, or proportion; the more his diſtinguiſhing Power is. It is ſo in Civil Affairs; a Sheriff is eclipſed in the Court, who ſhines in his County.</p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49060:20"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Axiome</hi> 4. The greater the <hi>Rex</hi> is, the more Words are under his Power, if more than Two Words, or Three at the moſt; a <hi>Major,</hi> like Lord Mayor, rides on the laſt Word of the Sentence; if the Members are leſſer, there is only a <hi>Minor Dominus,</hi> or a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> according to their mutual reſpect. If one part of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> conſiſts of little Members, the other of greater; there is a great Lord to divide <hi>Ex. gra. Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between her Seed and thy Seed.</hi> There is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     <p>This <hi>Axiome</hi> is pregnant of many particular Rules; but without Exemplification they are dry and uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Axiome</hi> 5. Where the Conſecution, according to the Grammatical Table, takes no place, either by undue Abſence, Preſence or diſplacement, the Rhetorical Table is to be inſpected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Axiome</hi> 6. As theſe Points are Rhetorical, they are not applicable to the Figures of our Rhetorick (tho as <hi>Glaſſius</hi> has demonſtrated, they are all to be found virtually in the Bible) but carry a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity to the Affection, Intention of the Author, and Moment of the Matter, which a live Orator would expreſs by Look, Geſture, Manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or ſome other Motion. For Inſtance, <hi>Paſſion, Haſte, Anger,</hi> is ſignified by putting a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49060:20"/> in place of a <hi>Lord;</hi> and on the contrary, <hi>Love, Delight, Momentouſneſs of Matter,</hi> is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by putting a <hi>Dom.</hi> in room of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> or a great <hi>Dominus</hi> for a leſſer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Axiome</hi> 7. The Poetick and Prophetick Books are ſo full of Alterations from the <hi>Grammar Table,</hi> that the Exceptions would exceed the Rules; yea, the former, <hi>viz. Job, Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> differ in the very Points themſelves, ſo that they need a diſtinct Table: This would ſtand a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Argument againſt their Validity; but ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious with the Rhetorick Table, that there is ſcarce any exception from both Tables; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently an efficacious Argument that that dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe was the deſign of the Author; for <hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingentibus non datur certa ſcientia,</hi> there cannot be any orderly <hi>Analyſis</hi> where there was no Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical <hi>Syntheſis;</hi> we may as well aſſert the Worlds Harmony out of <hi>Epicurean Atoms;</hi> or that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble came to paſs by a Shower of Letters; as theſe Points to be incerted, without the ends being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned that they are ſuch adapted Means for.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall conclude this Branch from the <hi>Talmud,</hi> with a Story out of <hi>Raban,</hi> who ſays, <hi>In his time,</hi> (i. e.

                     <p>As to the firſt, I find <hi>Capellus</hi> is content to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him, and allow that he contradicts himſelf, and therefore of no value; as the Woman was that wanted Motherly Affection, ſhe was willing that the live one ſhould be divided, tho it died for the Quarrel.

                     <p>I do obſerve here a very conſiderable Proof, both from <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> that the <hi>Vowels</hi> and <hi>Accents</hi> were not only exiſtent in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49060:30"/> Tongue before the Fifth, or Fourth Century ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but were imitated in other Tongues. (2.) That <hi>Hierom</hi> expreſſes more difficulty in conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Conſonants</hi> to one another, than the <hi>Vowels.</hi> It's true, he ſays elſewhere, That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath no <hi>vowels, viz. Tom Quarto,</hi> but he gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe they expreſs their <hi>Vowels</hi> and <hi>Points</hi> as the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> do <hi>Virgulis Literis affixis.</hi> I find yet nothing to prove, that <hi>Hierom</hi> made uſe of that in his Tranſlations, or Comments. But on the contrary, That he made uſe of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> For he expreſſes himſelf thus in Words, <hi>Why may not I make the</hi> Hebrew <hi>ſpeak</hi> Latine, <hi>as well as the</hi> Lxx, <hi>and</hi> Origen <hi>made it ſpeak</hi> Greek. He only uſes <hi>Origen</hi>'s in anſwering the <hi>Jews</hi> Mockery; he appeals to themſelves, if he had not as truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their Words in another Tongue as they themſelves could. But this fact of <hi>Origen</hi>'s being ſo evident, is to me a moſt powerful Proof, that the <hi>Points</hi> were known in the Second <hi>Century;</hi> in that he could ſo exactly turn them into <hi>Greek,</hi> as to ſtand the Challenge of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And that this Fact is true, <hi>Capellus</hi> confeſſes, <hi>Hierom</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſo, <hi>Epiphan. p.</hi> 534. he compoſed the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Scripture in <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters, in one Column, but in <hi>Greek</hi> Elements in the other, for the ſake of them who know not the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Elements.

                        </gap> on <hi>Earth,</hi> before <hi>was, and as to the Earth it was,</hi> ſhews that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s intent is only to diſcourſe on the Earth,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49060:33"/> how it was brought to perfection through ſeveral ſteps and degrees; the Heavens were not Man's Poſſeſſion nor Habitation. Therefore not his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in his created State. It had been to ſtuff his Head with Curioſity, to give him the Knowledge of other Globes, that is capable of knowing ſo little of his own. And therefore we read no more of that Heaven in this Chapter. But the place of Air and Stars, bearing that Name in <hi>Iſrael, Moſes</hi> muſt be ſubject to what <hi>vis &amp; norma loquendi</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in, and therefore calls that place <hi>Heaven.</hi> But adds a diſtinctive Term <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap> the Firmament, to prevent Equivocation. And <hi>Moſes</hi> would not uſe an equivocal Word, when the intent was to prevent it.

                        <hi>Capellus</hi> and <hi>Buxtorf, Walton</hi> and <hi>Waſmuth</hi> grant ſome great Work or Change about the Scripture by <hi>Ezra.</hi> But in this they differ, the one ſays that the <hi>Jews</hi> changed their Native Language for the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and put their Bible into that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The other ſays, That there were Two Copies of the Law, before <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time; the one Sacred, which is the <hi>Murbhah,</hi> or Quadrate Letter; The other Vulgar, like the preſent <hi>Samaritan.</hi> But in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, all their Copies were put in a Quadrate Letter; tho it is of no great Moment which of the Two Opinions is the trueſt as to my buſineſs; for it's a very ill conſequence, the <hi>Samaritan</hi> was before the Captivity, and ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; the <hi>Quadrate</hi> was ſince, and ſo corrected by Prophets: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Samaritan</hi> is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred (being the primitive.) Yet I ſhall propoſe theſe Teſtimonies, for the latter, <hi>Rabbi Aſarias</hi> in <hi>Meorenajim,</hi> ſays thus, <hi>In the time of the Second Temple there were two Copies of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Law, both writ: The one did conſiſt in</hi> Aſſyrian <hi>Writing, and Sacred Tongue, as the Books which are true and right, which we now poſſeſs; the other here and there varying, which was common among the People wrote in</hi> Hebrew, <hi>that is the Characters uſed beyond the River, which are left to the</hi> Idiots, <hi>that is</hi> Cutheans <hi>or</hi> Samaritans. To the ſame purpoſe ſaith the Authors of <hi>Ben Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. R. Gedaliah</hi> ſays, <hi>The Law was given in that kind of Writing which we now call</hi> Aſſyrian; this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49060:38"/> was always kept among the Princes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for the Vulgar uſed the <hi>Samaritan Hebrew;</hi> but when <hi>Ezra</hi> came, he let the People uſe the Figure wherein the Law was given. It's called <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> becauſe the Nobles of <hi>Iſrael</hi> brought it from thence with them; for they kept it there ſecret, becauſe it was the Holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abarbynell</hi> ſays, <hi>It is the Eighth Article of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Creed, to believe the Law that now is in our hands, is the ſame that was given in Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>without any Change.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ritbam</hi> ſays, The meaning of this Sentence in the <hi>Talm. viz. The Law was given in the days of</hi> Ezra, <hi>in the</hi> Aſſyrian <hi>Scripture, is, That an Edict went forth from</hi> Ezra, <hi>That all and every man ſhould write the Book of the Law in the</hi> Aſſyrian <hi>Figure, and no other;</hi> That for the future, they might uſe that kind of Writing wherein the Tables of the Law, and Book of the Law which was in the Ark was writ. And when it is ſaid in the <hi>Talmud, That in the beginning the Law was given to</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Writing;</hi> that's only meant of Books wrote for private uſe. <hi>For, the God of Mercy ſave us from thinking the Law that was in the Ark to be of that Character.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it ſeems a very probable thing, That theſe <hi>quieſcent</hi> Letters were the <hi>Vowels</hi> to the one, and the <hi>Points</hi> the <hi>Vowels</hi> to the other; which a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearch may bring more light into. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall conclude with this, <hi>That on a double account the Accentual Points have a priority to theſe Vowels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are ſome parts of the Bible yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Vowel-Points,</hi> but no part without <hi>accentual.</hi>

                     <p>IT is confeſſed by Biſhop <hi>Walton</hi> in his <hi>Prolog,</hi> tho he diſputes for the <hi>Tiberians</hi> being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of the Figures of theſe <hi>Points;</hi> Yet not of their Uſe and Value: that was before from <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, and before that too, and ſo <hi>Capellus</hi> and they think that either in Writing, or by faithful Tradition, it was preſerved in that Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. That they deny any more to be humane, but the Figure of theſe <hi>Points</hi> in that <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> againſt them (<hi>What the</hi> Maſorites <hi>are Authors of is humane, but the</hi> Maſorites <hi>are Authors of the ſenſe of the Old Teſtament,</hi> Prob. Minor, <hi>The form of Words are their Senſe; but they are Authors of the form,</hi> viz. <hi>the Points.</hi>) They diſtinguiſh and ſay, They are Authors of the Figure, not Sound, nor Uſe in Signification. The <hi>Engliſh Tranſlators</hi> are as much Authors of the Bible Senſe, by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Engliſh Signs</hi> to Communicate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Divine Senſe (before kept in <hi>Hebrew Signs</hi>) to <hi>Engliſh People.</hi> So the <hi>Tiberians</hi> Invented only theſe more fit Signs, for preventing Miſtakes and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49060:39"/> Errors creeping into that Senſe, which the Vocal and Traditional Signs were liable to let in: And when they are urged with the Improbability of keeping entire ſuch a Multitude of various Sounds, Senſes, and Uſes for a thouſand Years. They An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, may be though they were not Inſerted in the Bible, yet they were in a Book by themſelves, and then the <hi>Maſorites</hi> work is only Application, the Authority of the Points is Prophetical. But to paſs this by too, and not to urge Conceſſions at a ſtrait, too much (though <hi>Elias Levita,</hi> the only <hi>Jew,</hi> and the firſt Author of <hi>Tiberian Maſorits,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Aſſerted their Divinity.) Let us ſuppoſe their moſt Genuine Senſe, that the <hi>Maſorits</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Criticks</hi> and <hi>Grammarians;</hi> there were no Men ſuch Maſters of that Language, and by theſe Points they have conveyed to us the true Senſe of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> in their Day, which before was kept by Tradition. And though they did not believe, nor underſtand the <hi>Evangelical Doctrines,</hi> or <hi>Myſteries,</hi> wrapt up in the <hi>Grammatical Senſe</hi> of the Words; yet the <hi>Grammatical,</hi> or <hi>Oratorical</hi> Part of it they did well underſtand. As a <hi>Latiniſt</hi> can Conſtrue or Pierce <hi>Euclid,</hi> and when he has done, cannot find the Senſe, nor make out the Demonſtration: But an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mathematician ſitting by him, and hearing the <hi>Latiniſt,</hi> can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but without his help knew not a Syllable of it. The <hi>Tiberian Maſorite,</hi> in this caſe, is the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſt,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mathematician. But now ſuppoſing the Matters of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Concern, that this <hi>Chriſtian</hi> has it kept and lock'd up in this Book; and that there is not a Book in the World beſide that diſcovers and reveals this Matter; (there are indeed many Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49060:40"/> but through Time they are either altered, and corrupted, or the Tranſlators were unskilful, and were more guided by theſe Old Tranſlations, that very much contradicted one another, than by an exact Knowledge in the Original.) Now it this caſe we will ſuppoſe ſome Men not Infallible. But the greateſt Maſters of the Language in the World, when the Language began to be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, they put Marks of Sound, and Senſe; Marks to guide in the Diſtinction of Equivocal Words, and Marks to guide in <hi>Syntax</hi> upon this Book. But the Natives being ſatisfied with this Book, as they uſed it before, made no great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it; and when they taught the <hi>Christians,</hi> they taught that part of it they uſed, and the other part they knew not, ſo much of it is loſt. But a thouſand Years after this the World turns Inquiſitive; for during that time the whole Book, much more its Critical Art, was ſunk in Oblivion; and Religion, by Church Authority comes in Faſhion; until the Prieſts not only Impoſed on their Conſciences, and carved an Hell, or Heaven for them, as they thought fit; but on their Reaſon and Senſes; they would have the <hi>Laicks</hi> live on Hay, and give to them the Meat and the Bread. This awakened the Indignation of ſome, the Pity of others, and Eyes of All: but by degrees they firſt diſpute old Men's Authority with Young; the Dead with the Living; the Authority of Many and Few, Prieſts and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But this Book being providentially Alledged to favour each ſide, and being counted in that dark time ſo Sacred, it muſt not be touched. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that made <hi>David</hi> and the Young Men, eat <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> makes People venture to open the Sacred Book; but ſtill with Prayers to God to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49060:40"/> forgive, until they find therein a Command to Search. But the Prieſts have ſtill the better; for on ſome they impoſe the <hi>Legends, viz.</hi> the more Ignorant (as I have ſeen, and have yet Living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to prove it, that were with me in <hi>Spain</hi>) on all, a Tranſlation of their own making, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that is diſcovered, and the Diſpute now Terminates on the Original, and on the Exerciſe of Criticiſm about the Senſe. Now, I ſay, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from Divine Authority and Antiquity, Is not in ſuch a Juncture the Critical Art of ſo great Maſters, worth the greateſt Pains and Diligence of him that values this Book, either as the Food of his Soul, or Furniture of his Brain, in this Affair? So I do not impoſe Church Authority, but Art's Authority; we muſt believe every one in their own Art, until we be Maſters and Judges of it, which I find <hi>Capell</hi> frequently renouncing, when <hi>Buxtorf</hi> Challenges him for wrong Tranſlating <hi>Zohar</hi> and <hi>Maimonides.</hi> But as to this part of it which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, neither he, nor <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> ever ſaw. It ſeems he has looked on <hi>Ledebh.</hi> but he that reads what he ſays, and what follows in this Book, will eaſily be Convinced he knew not <hi>Ledebh</hi>'s Intent; for he looks on it as Madneſs, as a <hi>Plow-man</hi> would on <hi>Algebra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt Branch</hi> I think fit to Inſiſt upon here, is the Uſe of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> in the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> for if that be not very neceſſary, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Points are not. Neither Antiquity, nor the Late Days of our Reformation, have wanted Men, who Contemned the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> though they delighted in the Name of <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Of this kind were the Followers of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnians,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49060:41"/> Marcionites,</hi> and <hi>Manichees.</hi> The moſt Famous of this Latter Age, were the <hi>Munſter-Men,</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> and <hi>Mennonites,</hi> called in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> though in this Point they both Hope and Believe moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to them that go under that Name in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> There is another pair of this kind ſtill, and that is Men that are highly <hi>Enthuſiaſtick;</hi> and Men that pretend to no Rule but Reaſon. <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> the <hi>Socinian,</hi> will allow the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> for Illuſtration and Commendation, but not for Proof; he will not admit it as a Principle of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and rather give it a Practical Slight, than any Verbal Diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>In Anſwer to all which, It is very certain they give little Credit to the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that do not think the <hi>Old</hi> its fellow, or rather Father or Foundation. For CHRIST, and his Apoſtles, borrowed all their Arguments for the Truth of that Doctrine which is now called <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> out of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and that with ſuch a Charge, that he rejects all from being his Diſciples who did not embrace it. <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, for in them you think ye have Eternal Life; and they are they which teſtifie of me. If you believe not his Writings, How ſhall ye believe my Words.</hi> Luk. 24, 25. <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart to believe, all the Prophets have ſpoken, and beginning at Moſes, and all the Prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the things concerning Himſelf.</hi> Vide Ver. 32. &amp; 45, 46. The <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> was not only the Book out of which Chriſt Taught, and made all his Diſciples; but the Book out of which the Apoſtles Taught <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> For the firſt Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years after Chriſt it remained a <hi>Canon</hi> to all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49060:41"/> the Churches, the Mean of Converſion, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Place of Arguments, and Text to all the Apoſtles. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on Him, ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> This was the Sum of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, through the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery whereof the Holy Ghoſt fell on all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: So that the Ordinances that were the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Spirit, were all bottom'd on this Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.2. <hi>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath Days Reaſoned with them out of the Scriptures.</hi> So that all his Diſputations were founded on the Scripture; that the Synagogue owned. And as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Logick was Built on that Foundation: So was <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oratory, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.24. He was an Eloquent Man, and mighty in the Scriptures. He mightily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhowing by the Scriptures, That Jeſus was the Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> Retracted nothing of this in his latter Days; for 24.14. <hi>So Worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law, and the Prophets: Therein do I exerciſe my ſelf.</hi> Though he adviſed a Young <hi>Timothy</hi> to do ſo, he did not think it fit for an Old <hi>Paul</hi> to leave that Exerciſe, of <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unto this day, witneſſing both to ſmall and great, ſaying none other things than thoſe which Moſes and the Prophets did ſay ſhould come.</hi> This he particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 3. <hi>Chriſt dyed for our Sins, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures; He was buried, and roſe again the third day, according to the Scriptures.</hi> There was no Article of Faith, but what was reduced to this Canon, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29. <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God.</hi> It was this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, this <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49060:42"/> old Age, recommended to all Believers, as the moſt ſure Word, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>As unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place.</hi> Becauſe at firſt, it came not by the Will of Man, but by the Holy Ghoſt. Neither do the dying Apoſtles recommend any other Scriptures to their Succeſſors: For <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. he adviſes his to continue in what things he had learned; <hi>For from a Child he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Holy Scriptures; which was able to make him wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> Neither do we find any other Book mentioned under the Name of Scripture, in all the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> I do not ſay all this to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Apoſtolick Doctrine from being a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; but that its a Foundation Built on the Prophetical, that the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is a Hiſtory of the Fulfilment of ſome of the old Prophecies, and a Prophetical Enlargement of what is not Fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. It is the Faith of the <hi>Old,</hi> ſuited to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the <hi>New,</hi> after the Exhibition of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is the Book, and the <hi>New</hi> is the Comment: The <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is the Text, the <hi>New</hi> is the Sermon; and it were a moſt unreaſonable thing to prefer the Laſt to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And though the Churches of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> are the Pillars of the Truth, there is no Hiſtory gives us account of that Accuracy, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and Pains or Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, in Collecting, and Concluding the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that we have of the <hi>Old.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Second Motive</hi> that I ſhall uſe for Diligence in this Study is, That though a Man may be a good Chriſtian (without knowledge of the Original) yet he cannot be an able Teacher, and that not only <hi>Primis labiis guſtare:</hi> For he that hath only taſted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49060:42"/> of a thing, is far from a Sufficiency to fill his Belly, or a Plenty to Diſpence to others. A Man can never be an Able Miniſter of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> without being well skill'd in the <hi>Originals.</hi> By great Divines this is thought the Senſe of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.52. <hi>Every Scribe which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed into the Kingdom of Heaven, is like to an Houſholder which bringeth forth of his Treaſure things new and old.</hi> The <hi>Old</hi> are <hi>ex ipſo fonte,</hi> to drink the Waters of Life from the Original. The <hi>New,</hi> ſays <hi>Altingius,</hi> are all the Tranſlations and Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that as ſo many Rivulets have flowed from thence. The Treaſure, ſays another, is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures; the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> are the Types and Anti-Types, the Prophecies and Fulfilments, the Promiſes and Experiences. But it is farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable here, That <hi>Scribe</hi> is a Title that Chriſt gives to <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Miniſters, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.34. Every Miniſter is to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a Man of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, a Bookiſh Man. He is not one of Chriſt's Miniſters, that pretends to it without Learning.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As he is to be a Diſciple, he is ſuppoſed to have had a Maſter; <hi>Every Scribe who is taught,</hi> ſaith the Text. There was never yet a Teacher in the World, whom God ſent to Preach, but he could give account who taught him. The <hi>Jews</hi> call <hi>Moſes</hi> their Maſter: Our Lord Jeſus profeſſes, <hi>He received his Doctrine from his Father, He had given to him the Tongue of the Learned.</hi> Chriſt was a Man of Letters, a Learned Man: though the Authors differ, the Effects do not. <hi>How knoweth this Man Letters</hi> (ſay the <hi>Jews) having never Learned?</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> enjoins <hi>Timothy, to commit what he had learned unto faithful men, who might be able to teach others.</hi>

The Stealing of the Word of the Lord one from another is a great Fault, when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes himſelf to be Teacher to all. I ſhall end this <hi>Motive</hi> with one more Text of this kind, and that's the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Character of a Teacher, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thou art a Jew:</hi> The Word is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap>, that is, Thou art a <hi>Jew</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:49060:43"/> by Name and Profeſſion. It is not here diſtinctive of a Nation, but of a Religion. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. <hi>I know the Blaſphemy of them who call themſelves Jews, and are not, but the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> A be-lied Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not Blaſphemy, but a be-lied Profeſſion is. Then every Teacher muſt be a Profeſſor, though every Profeſſor is not a Teacher; but (2.) And <hi>reſteſt in the Law.</hi> This Law is the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Kingdom of Heaven before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: He is not to be a Lawleſs Perſon, nor a Perſon under the Law; but the Law muſt be in him, and he muſt live in it. This Word <hi>Reſt in the Law,</hi> is very Emphatick, and yet more ſo in the <hi>Greek,</hi> than in the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> For it imports this Law not only to be the Object of their Work, but the Satisfaction of their Heart: they ſaw all their deſire in it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>And makeſt thy boaſt of God</hi>— Glorying to call Him thine, and to be called by him. But in an eſpecial manner here, it imports a Glorying in his Teſtimony, and his Authority, and depending on no Teſtimony elſe. <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>How can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, who receive honour one of another.</hi> That is, depend on one another's Teſtimony. <hi>Have any of the Phariſees or Princes believed in him,</hi> John 7.26.48. The receiving a Doctrine as an Oracle of Truth, or Orthodox, from Man, is to pay that Honour to Man that is due to God only. This ſeems to be their fault, who profeſs themſelves to be <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>Apollo</hi>'s, and <hi>Cephas</hi>'s. He that can ſay, <hi>I Profeſs thus Truth, becauſe I read it in the Word, and Words of God,</hi> he glories in God as his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There follows in this Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Knowledge attainable under this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49060:44"/>
                     <p>The <hi>First</hi> is being Inſtructed, or Catechiſed out of the Law; that is, by a Live Voice, by the Mouth of the Teacher, in Queſtion and Anſwer, to receive in the Principles of Religion in our rude Minds.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, <hi>And knoweſt his Will.</hi> Catecheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Knowledge depends on another's Faith, but Knowledge upon a more proper bottom, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> firſt Believed, becauſe the Woman told them, but afterwards they truſted their own Eyes and Ears: The former is <hi>Credulity,</hi> the latter is <hi>Firm Knowledge,</hi> which can never want Deſire, and Delight to attend it, when fixed on the Law of God. The Knowledge of the Original, doth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily contribute to this Solidity and Firmneſs; and eſpecially this part of the Knowledge. For what can a Perſon that is Ignorant of the Tongue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in a Text tortured to three or four ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſes, by ſo many various Criticks, who is Skilful in no Rule by which he may Judge who is <hi>right,</hi> and who is <hi>wrong.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>And approveſt the things that are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; or can prove what's to be preferred where things differ.</hi> This Man (ſays the Apoſtle) is not only able to Guide a poor, blind, ignorant One, but is capable to <hi>be a Light to them that ſit in Darkneſs;</hi> who, without Prudence, that is <hi>Phariſee</hi>-like, think they have Knowledge enough. <hi>Capellus</hi> is offended that <hi>Ledeburius</hi> ſhould ſo much exalt the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe <hi>Hebrew Accents,</hi> and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count extols them as ſuch, who would Defend the Sacred Scriptures from the Injuries of diſtorted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, and that would inſinuate the native Senſe of every Sentence into the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Mind: And further Aſſerts, That certainly the Sin muſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49060:44"/> be very great, and Divine Judgments on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count very ſevere, that God ſhould ſuffer ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ineſtimable a Treaſure to lye hid in his Church undiſcovered. And again, admires the Free Grace and Mercy of God, who would reſtore it in ſo ſinful an Age. He ſays he could very well bear his <hi>Pareneſis,</hi> or Exhortation, if it were to perſuade the Study of the <hi>Hebrew Tongue.</hi> Therefore to prevent offending any, I ſhall make the <hi>Motives</hi> of a more general Nature. But in the mean time, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the <hi>Reader</hi> to conſider, either from Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Examples, what a bulky and uſeful part of the <hi>Hebrew Grammar,</hi> or Language this is.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third Motive</hi> I ſhall uſe, Is the Rarity or Scarceneſs of it. The Late Enquiring Age has found out many things, <hi>Printing, <hi>Powder, Bombs, Short-Hand-Writing, The Pointing at the North-Pole by the Magnetified Needle and Card, Teleſcopes, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying-Glaſſes,</hi>
                        </hi> &amp;c. Its certain, <hi>Divinity</hi> has its <hi>Depths</hi> not yet Div'd into; <hi>Myſteries</hi> unknown to us, that are in this Revealed Book; and to bring forth New and Old, ſeems to be well Expounded, by not Repeating the ſame things always to the People. And what can they do elſe that ſearches no further? Some think one Day in a Week enough for <hi>Study.</hi> The Study of others is <hi>Populo ut placerent quas feciſſent fabulas.</hi> It is not their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, if True or Falſe. <hi>Methodiſts</hi> is a Title due to more than them that wear it as a Livery of an Opinion. The blind Horſe in the Mill is a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt;</hi> he has his Round, and is moſt Faithful to it. A Man may be Excommunicated as an <hi>Heretick</hi> for a Sound and Comfortable Doctrine by ſuch <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts:</hi> And a Man may receive his Degrees of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49060:45"/> 
                        <hi>Phi.</hi> without a Penny-worth of Learning, and an Office of Divinity, by Reading others Works. But to paſs by ſuch Mockers of God, and Deceivers of the People, there are many Men, many Learned Men, Late Men, not only <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but <hi>Foreigners,</hi> who Trade more in the Art of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> that know nothing of this part of the Art: Even <hi>Lutheriſm,</hi> where <hi>Rabbiniſm</hi> reigns: Even <hi>Jews,</hi> where the Language is native: Even <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> where the Art is their Buſineſs. <hi>Sebaſt.

But in <hi>England</hi> its <hi>rara avis in terris.</hi> I may challenge
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49060:45"/> the Man has ſpoke, or wrote on it. Its then a Jewel rare and uſeful. <hi>Rembeck,</hi> 1692. ſays, That our Laborious Tranſlators were like the old Mariners, who Coaſted it along by the help of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tranſlations, but knew not the Magnetick Vertue in the Points of this Compaſs. But what Tranſlation ſhall a Man Confide in? The Lxx. ſays <hi>Voſſius,</hi> for that was before Chriſt's time. <hi>Reſp.</hi> He cannot prove that Chriſt, or his Apoſtles uſed it, but the contrary may be proved.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Voſſius</hi> owns that there are four dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Editions of that: The <hi>Compluten, Venetian, Roman,</hi> and <hi>Alexandrian.</hi> there is no ſuch variety in the <hi>Original,</hi> nor in its Points.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, None of them are Uncorrupted, as he grants, nor is there Credibility that any of them are the True Copies of what was before Chriſt. The <hi>Alexandrian</hi> is preferred in <hi>England,</hi> and put in the <hi>Polyglot,</hi> becauſe a Famous MSS. of it is in the King's Library. Another ſays, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Noble Lady, Madam <hi>Thecla,</hi> was the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber, the only Authority it has, but enough, may be for that Day. <hi>Modo pulchra fuit.</hi> I find the half of that Famous Prophecy, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>The wonderful Counſellor, the ſtrong God, the Eternal Father, the Prince of Peace;</hi> all that I find wanting in it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 18. a great part of that Verſe is wanting, <hi>viz.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> ſays, Whatever we have now under that Name of the Lxx. was certainly never ſeen by them. <hi>Druſius</hi> ſays, Its a Reproach to impute this Book called ſo to them. <hi>Calovius Glaſſius, Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and <hi>Alting,</hi> in his <hi>Theol.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49060:46"/> purpoſe <hi>Origen</hi> ſhould have Collected his <hi>Hexapla &amp; Octupla,</hi> if the Lxx. had been ſo pure a Piece in his Days. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays of it, That in his Day there were Three contending for the Prehemency; the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> the <hi>Antiochean,</hi> and that called the <hi>Middle:</hi> And if we will ſtand to <hi>Jerom</hi>'s own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, I think he values that leaſt of all, that is in the <hi>Octupla</hi> of <hi>Origen.</hi> But let <hi>Capellus</hi>'s own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict commend it, who ſays, Its corrupted in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of places.</p>
                     <p>

But where is it? The Vulgar, and his own Quotations agree not: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Vulgar is not his. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they have Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it, or Corrected it (by what Rule?) often, and as <hi>Weems</hi> ſays of <hi>Clement,</hi> he Tranſgreſs'd the Canon of the Church, that forbids Baptiſm before the Child is born, for he declared it Authentick, and then Corrected it. But among all their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons at <hi>Trent,</hi> none were obtained with ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, nor ſuch Irregularneſs, as that of making the <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation Authentick: Its thought not to have above Forty Votes. I fancy we might gather more for the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> It is true, its much better; but a Tranſlation will never be an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, nor what is Human become Divine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>R. Jehuda Levita,</hi> the Author of <hi>Coſri,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about Seven Hundred Years ago, was the laſt we find had Skill in this Affair.

Now having followed the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Senſe</hi> of the Text, let us try if it will help to remove the great Difficulty how this Prophecy is Fulfill'd.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Second of <hi>Darius,</hi> wherein <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> began to Prophecy, was <hi>An. Nab.</hi> 326.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Apply it from 212, to 788. are 576 Years, that is, 490 of Proſperity, and 85 of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, eſpecially in a Spiritual Senſe. The 490 from <hi>Cyrus</hi> Edict, to the Diſanulling the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and that People, are divided in Three Parcels. The Firſt is ſeven Weeks, or forty nine Years, between <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Edict, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his. The whole of the Time is 114 Years. But <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.5. &amp; 8.19. we read of 70 Years of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49060:50"/> Carnal and Selfiſh Faſting, which ended in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Joy and Gladneſs, on the <hi>ſecond,</hi> or <hi>ſixth</hi> at leaſt of <hi>Darius,</hi> when the Temple was finiſhed; which <hi>Zechariah</hi> Prophecy'd to be done by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord. Forty ſix of this (<hi>John</hi> 2.20.) was ſpent in Building the Temple, as the Spirit moved them; for the Eſſuſion of the Spirit began with <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Edict, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and through its Power they continued the Work againſt all Oppoſition, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 24. until it was with-drawn. For, <hi>Haggai</hi> 1. when God, on <hi>Darius</hi>'s Edict, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored his Spirit to them, there was no Life, nor Heart in them for that work. Their cry was, <hi>The Time was not come:</hi> though they found it ſeaſonable to Build Palaces for themſelves. So here is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently 49 Years of Spiritual and Temple Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and 70 of Carnal Security. There is indeed a little Fraction of three or four Years, between 114 Years and 118, but it makes neither 10 to the one Number, nor a Week to the other: The 49 Years in the firſt place, and the 70 in the Laſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second Portion</hi> is the greateſt and eaſieſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 434 Years, or 62 Weeks, wherein all ſhould be reſtored, and repaired, that was deſtroyed by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> ver. 25. (it is well Tranſlated, <hi>What was cut off, or broken,</hi> as in the Margin) there is warning, that this time ſhould not want its Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and indeed great they were in <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Time eſpecially. But the Spirit of the Lord did not forſake them, as their Holineſs, Zeal, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Victories, did teſtifie; as may be read in the <hi>Macchabees</hi> Now add 434 Years to 326, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Darius,</hi> when the Spirit was reſtored to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zecharias</hi> Teſtifie. Now add
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49060:50"/> to 326, which is the Second of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> 434. and the reſult is, 760, or 759. the <hi>Penult</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> and Twelfth of Chriſt, when the Meſſias made his Firſt Active and Admired Appearance in the Temple, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.41. which was Propheſied by <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.16, 17. And hereunto Meſſias the Prince. This Period agrees, not only with <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Canon, but <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s alſo, who ſays, <hi>Darius</hi>'s Second fell in <hi>Ann.</hi> 1594. from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Birth, and <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s his Laſt, except one, in 2027. And Thirdly, with the Eclipſes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the firſt by <hi>Thycid.</hi> the ſecond by <hi>Dion. Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius;</hi> and both Compared by <hi>Bunting,</hi> Fol. 217. But now there is a Segment at the end of this Period, plainly Indicated, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>After threeſcore and two weeks.</hi> Which proves that the Meſſias was to have an Illuſtrious Advent at the end of 434 Years. But his Death, which was to be within the 490, ver. 24. and within the laſt Week, for an Expiation was to be made, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. Sacrifice, and Oblation made to ceaſe, was to be ſome conſiderable time after. This I thus apply from Chriſt's <hi>Twelfth, viz.</hi> 17 Years, to his 30th Year, wherein both <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and HE, began their Miniſtery, was a time of as great deadneſs, lifeleſneſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Spirit, as ever they were under until now, as the Goſpel Glory informs us: The State full of <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Herodians;</hi> and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple full of <hi>Phariſees;</hi> the Land full of <hi>Prophanity.</hi> Before this there was a <hi>Zecharias</hi> and a <hi>Simeon</hi> in the Temple; and after this a great Reformation, which brings me to the Third and Laſt Portion, <hi>viz.</hi> one Week, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. He ſhall Confirm the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with many for one Week, or ſeven Years: In the midſt whereof he was to offer a Sacrifice,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49060:51"/> that needed no other to ſucceed, that anſwered all their Ends, and in <hi>which</hi> they all ended. Three and an half of this time was fulfilled by Chriſt in his own Miniſtery, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s, by which many were Converted, and brought within the Bond of the Covenant, and even their Ordinances reſtored to Purity, according to <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. The <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and <hi>John Baptſt</hi>'s Office was to Purifie the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> that they might Offer unto the Lord Offerings of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as in former times. Its not a Seaſon to forget the Purity of Ordinances, becauſe Chriſt's Coming, and their End is nigh. Its beſt to be found, like <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> walking in the Ordinances, all of them without blame. And three and an half after his Death by the Apoſtles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Calling of the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to his Work. <hi>After which</hi> we hear of few or none Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Their Miniſters Work was to Preſerve and Nouriſh what was Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

Dom.</hi> 1034. ſome have borne the Name of <hi>Maſorite,</hi> according to <hi>Elias,</hi> and have been a Hedge to Letters, Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Words, telling their Number, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is the middle Word of each Book; the Defects or Exceſſes in Letters of a Word; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, or difference in Words called <hi>Keri,</hi> and <hi>Ketib.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This difference is rarely in Senſe, but in Letters, as א 12 times is redundant at the end of a Word, and ן 43 times in the beginning; 56 Words wrote with ד at the beginning, but read with י</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe Differences are not many, 848 ſays <hi>Elias Levita.</hi> Its true, there are more in <hi>Clode</hi>'s late Bible.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is the difference in Senſe that theſe Points are moſt helpful in, and that concerns us moſt. Chriſt's Promiſe, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.) of no Points periſhing from the Law, is faithfully kept, ſo long as we have the Senſe intire. And thus we may defend the Integrity of the <hi>Hebrew Text.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Second <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is to prevent, or with-ſtand the <hi>Scepticiſm of this Age,</hi> a very ill, but flouriſhing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49060:55"/> Weed grown up in the Garden of <hi>Criticiſm. Some,</hi> ſays <hi>Thilo, by accident promote this, when they propoſe the different Sentiments of the Learned without Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In which Number</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Famous and moſt Laborious Work of <hi>Pool</hi> is to be reckoned. For what one builds, another deſtroys; and the Oppoſition diſtracts the Mind, and leaves the tender Conſcience is Fluctuation, but fills the Cavillers Mouth with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How few</hi> (ſays he) <hi>were the Arguments of the Papiſts, to prove the Scriptures being a Sufficient, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and Perfect Rule; until now they ſee every Particle of Sacred Writ, diſſolved into various Senſes, by the Patronage of Learned Criticks? Any Man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>may Palliate any Profeſſion from the</hi> Synopſis <hi>of <hi>Pool.</hi> Now this is a great Medium to keep the Mind like a Rock, ſtable againſt ſuch Winds and Tides of Temptation, that the Student may be ſtable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in the Senſe of Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Inſtance I ſhall bring for Illuſtration of this Uſe, is 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.17, 18, 19. It is pregnant of a Twin Difficulty; one <hi>ver.</hi> 17. whether <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> intreats for a Burden of <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Mould, for an Altar to be built in <hi>Syria:</hi> or, if he asks leave to give to <hi>Gehazi,</hi> at leaſt a part of the Preſent which he had ſo peremptorily refuſed. The other, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. whether <hi>Naaman</hi> intreats for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence in his Civil Office, that had the viſible appearance of Idolatry attending it, when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter went to Worſhip <hi>Saturn,</hi> or <hi>Remphan,</hi> the moſt high God, in the <hi>Syrian</hi> account: Or, if he asks Pardon for Adoring ſuch an Idol formerly.</p>
                     <p>There is a <hi>Third Queſtion,</hi> Whether <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well be of a Civil or Religious Nature? But this will come in, in Subordination to the others.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49060:55"/> Among others, there have been two Famous Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of treating this Text, as a Foundation of ſome Caſuiſtick Caſes; the former in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, on the Prince of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s carrying the Sword before the Emperor to <hi>Maſs,</hi> but not without a preceding Proteſtation. The latter on the King of <hi>France</hi>'s becoming Maſter of <hi>Strasburgh;</hi> then the Learned <hi>Schmidt</hi> could ſee from this Text, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it was Lawful to uſe indifferent Things for Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of great Benefits, or good Men, either in the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New-Teſtament-Church. Secondly,</hi> That a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may lawfully be preſent at Falſe, or Idolatrous Worſhip; if from a weighty Cauſe, Eccleſiaſtick, Civil, or Politick. For if then any were offended, it was Offence taken, not given. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it was better for <hi>Naaman</hi> to Sacrifice at <hi>Syria,</hi> than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally omit it. For to Sacrifice is the Duty of all: To Sacrifice at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> only the Duty of <hi>Iſrael. Fourthly,</hi> The weak, or infirm, are to be borne with in their uſing things indifferent for Religious Service.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pleiſfer,</hi> in his <hi>Dubia,</hi> 1685. after ſetting a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of great Names one againſt another, ſays; <hi>If the Method of his Book did not neceſſitate him to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſomething,</hi> Plane ſedebat animo, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap>, he <hi>ſhould leave the Reader to Judge.</hi> At preſent I ſhall Judge againſt him, except in his Preliminaries, where he renounceth the Thoughts of <hi>Aben Ezra, viz. That Naaman asked leave to diſſemble in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, or to Worſhip Rimmon with <hi>Iehovah,</hi>
                        </hi> ver. 17. The Words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap> Now the Author of <hi>Coſri</hi>'s Rule is to be minded, <hi>viz.</hi> We are to ſuppoſe our ſelves over-hearing the Diſcourſe, and expreſſing Affections and Paſſions

Now (ſays he) the <hi>Accents</hi> are in place of theſe lively Actions. The <hi>Accents</hi> by which the Bible is read, denotes (ſays he) Stops, Pauſes, Slowneſs of Speech; and, <hi>e contra,</hi> Haſte, or Continuation, Admiration, or any Paſſion. Now the Prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. had refuſed his Gifts abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely. <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. he Anſwers and Replies, full of wonder, and amazing Thoughts. <hi>And Naaman ſaid;</hi> but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

At laſt he replies, having thought of two Expedients at once, and he unites them, to make them have the greater force. Obſerve this <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween reſpective Propoſitions. The Sign, and Thing ſignified, is frequent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Num.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5. ver. 12. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.18. &amp; 9.36. If he were going to ſpeak of a new Subject, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a new Queſtion, the Paſſion would leave boiling, at leaſt appear ſo, until he ſaw what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs it ſhould have.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> He propoſes the Expedient in general thus <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> here <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

If that Method be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49060:56"/> may not this? <hi>viz. Let it be given to thy Servant;</hi> here again ends a Propoſition. So the Expedient is a change of Perſons, the Servant may take it ſure, if the Maſter do not. If he had not meant the ſame Bleſſing he ſpoke of before, his Senſe had not been Intelligible to the Prophet. The <hi>Second Expedient</hi> is, The Denominating, Qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of what he intended to give, <hi>A load of duſt, Neh.</hi> 9.1. As much Duſt as was only in one Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, only drawn by two Mules, much leſs than what he ſaw there in many Waggons. So much Earth would have borne little Bulk in an Altar, they muſt have been beholden to Tradition for the Monument, more than to the Monument for the Story. But it was probably the Fruits of the Land of <hi>Syria.</hi> And this he preſſes with a new Motive; he was reſolved to Worſhip the Prophet's God, only; he needed not reject his Gift, as an Idolater. So there is little Ground left in this Earth, for Relick-Worſhip to grow upon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second Difficulty</hi> is, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. whether it be a Pardon or Indulgence? He asks; If it be a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for paſt Idolatry, or leave to continue in his Office, that had ſo offenſive an Ingredient in it. I am for the firſt. For firſt, the Verb <hi>Bow or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> is in the <hi>Pretertenſe.</hi> Its true, there is ן but not Converſive, for the <hi>Accent</hi> ſtill remains in the <hi>Penult.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Its a Religious Bowing he begs Pardon for: Would God Pardon, or the Prophet Indulge known Idolatry, wilful Idolatry. The Office is in <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </hi> But (ſays he) <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>In this thing the Lord pardon thy Servant. When my Maſter came into the Houſe of Rimmon, he lean'd on my hand, and then I worſhipped in the Houſe of Rimmon. In that I did Worſhip in the Houſe of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy Servant in this thing.</hi> A little Worſhip ſerved a Soldier; he was Generaliſſimo, not being much acquainted in Caſes of Conſcience.

For when he Meditates on the Caſe, he laments that his Maſter did not take what he offered, <hi>viz.</hi> Ten Talents of Silver, and 6000 Pieces of Gold.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there are two hundred more, and more momentous Corruptions in them, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> too.

And, ſecondly, yet more to ſay, He did it that He might deſtroy them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How unbecoming Knowledge of God would this Exhibit? Yea, ſuppoſe to Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, did ſignifie to permit it, but for that no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be brought, except Abſurdity otherways Conſequent.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is contrary to Conſecution of Points to change the Perſon, it is much more conſiſtent to continue the ſame Perſon thus, <hi>In that I cauſed,</hi> &amp;c. And this gives a Key to all, which is to be turned, thus; <hi>I pronounced them, with their gifts, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi> Lev. 13.2. <hi>When I paſſed over the firſt-born,</hi>

And this for a double end, <hi>That I might render them amaz'd, or fill them with admiration,</hi> Job 21.5. Ezek. 35.15. &amp; 3.15. And 2. <hi>That they might know that I am the Lord.</hi> The Conſtitution of the Prieſts did illuſtrate God's Holineſs, and Typifie the Mediator.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fourth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is, That which I firſt learned, and will undertake to inſtruct another Man in an Hours time, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Analyſis</hi> of any Verſe or Text, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its greateſt greater, leſſer and leaſt Members; and that with ſuch certainty, that let any Man tell me the Points, without telling me where the Verſe is, or what the Words are in it; I ſhall tell him every Diviſion, and Sub-diviſion the Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, where every Propoſition ends; what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are moſt related, and what moſt oppoſed, and what are the Circumſtantial Words to the Propoſition. This may ſave Students many Hours pains, who frequently labour under a Difficulty, about what are to be United, what Divided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will enable to give Obedience to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Paſtoral Letter to <hi>Timothy,</hi> about rightly Dividing the Word of Truth. To give an Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Affecting Anatomy; not a Butcherly forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cutting things aſunder, that the Spirit of God has United. I remember that witty Book, call'd, <hi>The Contempt of the Clergy,</hi> Ridicules this Phraſe; <hi>That the Text divides it ſelf.</hi> But we may ſee it is a Sacred Truth; for theſe Points leave it not to our Arbitration, how many Members, or Branches, or what kind of ones the Text is to be divided in. For the Text divides it ſelf, or the Authors of the Text, at leaſt of theſe Points. To aſſiſt thee in this, theſe few Rules are ſufficient.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That beſide theſe Eſſentials of a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, there are Adjuncts, as How? Where? When? Why? Who?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the <hi>Analyſer,</hi> if he can truly divide every Verſe in a Chapter, may Divide, or <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſe</hi> the whole Chapter aright; and he that knows the true determined Senſe of every Verſe, is able to underſtand the whole Chapter.

                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude this <hi>Logical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of the Points, I ſhall Illuſtrate it with ſome Examples, which may be found in the two Laſt Chapters of this Book; at preſent take this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. The Points are thus <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> from which, without Knowledge of the Words, I can ſee the Text is not only to be Divided into two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, but of different Subject. The Matter of the one <hi>Hemiſtich</hi> is diſtinct from the other; for the middle Point is <hi>Atnach.</hi> See the Rule.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That each of theſe <hi>Hemiſtichs</hi> is to be Sub-divided into two Propoſitions; for there is a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in each, which by the Rule ſtands always on the end of a Sentence, and has another between him and the abſolute Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the ſingle Terms being more in the firſt Propoſition, than in the following; it is likely it contains ſome common thing to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for it contains four Words, the other three only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That though this Text contains but 15 Words, it muſt contain at leaſt 12 or 11 diſtinct Subjects to be treated on, for there are 10 Lords.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49060:64"/> Now let us turn to the Words, and we may fill up theſe Blanks with the Work of God in the firſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtich,</hi> and the Office of Chriſt in the Second. The firſt Propoſition contains God's Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, changing the Temper of Man's Mind, putting Enmity where Love was, and Love where Enmity. The <hi>Second</hi> contains God's Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
                     <p>Where, as was noted, Enmity is to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Here is indeed the Promiſe of a Seed imply'd; for where the individual Life was forfeited, the Title to Increaſe was ſurely loſt; beſides, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was to both Conjugated, this <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to the Woman apart.</p>
                     <p>But here is expreſſed an Enmity, and that by Divine Conſtitution, between this Seed and Satan; and there is moreover here expreſſed ſome Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Difference between the Enmity, as it ſtands in this Member, and the Member before; for little Members needs only little Lords: here is a great one indeed, ſince we know the Subject to be Chriſt, the only Seed of Woman alone: We know that as to Woman there was a neceſſity of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in order to Enmity, but here's no need, for that would render the Emphaſis on the firſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for God doth more where he is Lord of Hoſts, and manages the War, and alſo infuſes Ability and Will for the Battle, than where he is only <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> being on the Second, ſignifies the Heat of the Battle to lie on Him, and that God had more to do in and through Chriſt, in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Work of Satan, than in Man, though a new Creation be neceſſary in him. The whole Work of God then in Conquering Satan through Chriſt,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49060:65"/> is in the <hi>Second Propoſition.</hi> The <hi>Third Propoſition</hi> contains all the Activity of Chriſt, as King or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator in that Affair. And the <hi>Fourth,</hi> all his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
                     <p>The Scope of the Verſe is pointed at in the Word <hi>Enmity,</hi> for 1. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is by it. 2. It is a Threatning 3. All is exerted through it; Satan's Malice, the Regenerate Man's Grace, the Mediator's Office, and the God of Hoſts, as Glorifying his Holineſs in all.</p>
                     <p>Every little Lord has ſome conſiderable Subject, 1. <hi>Heel,</hi> Chriſt's Humanity. 2. <hi>Head,</hi> Satan's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Dominion; its now over Death, Darkneſs, this World, but the World to come, ſhall not be Subject to him: he fell much at Chriſt's Aſcenſion: before that we find him appearing in Heaven, among the Angels, but <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6. He was then caſt down to the Earth, when Chriſt aſcended on High, and led them that uſe to take <hi>Captive Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;</hi> but he will meet with a more ſevere Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fifth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is, To Reconcile the Citations in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> with the Original Text in the <hi>Old,</hi> which if they effectually do, I think it is no ſmall Argument of their Authentickneſs. But it muſt not be here forgotten, that they are Miniſters of Senſe, not Sound or Letters; and therefore I cannot undertake more by them, than to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Senſe: the Words may differ without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to this.</p>
                     <p>Another Caution I muſt add, That this is not the only Mean of Reconciling Difficulties of that kind, though its a great one. But Inſtances muſt beſt Illuſtrate the Caſe, and make theſe Points ſpeak for themſelves. <hi>Pulchrum eſt Digito de monſtrari &amp; dicier, hic eſt.</hi>

The Prophet from the beginning of the Chapter, having fore-told <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>'s happy Days under the Reign of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> gives warning of intervening Clouds, that would turn that bright Morning of Chriſt's Birth into Blackneſs, and Eclipſe that Morning-Star, with all his Oriental Beams: The cries of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> ſhould be heard, even as far as <hi>Rama,</hi> on the other ſide of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Grave (that gave name to the Country) ſhould the ſorrow of <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Death be re-acted, the Birth of her Son could not comfort her.

The <hi>New Teſtament</hi> has as much Relation to the <hi>Old</hi> now it is wrote, as before, when ſpoke, therefore there is no Refuge left in this common <hi>Aſylum.</hi> We may learn from this alſo, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of ſome Men's Arguments againſt the Scriptures Divinity, or the Divinity of ſome Subſtantial Doctrine in it, from the diſagreement of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> from the <hi>Old.</hi> Our Fathers have done great Service in ſearching out theſe Quotations, it is no great wonder if they have omitted ſome, or miſtaken ſome; but it is a ſad Concluſion that the Scripture contradicts it ſelf, becauſe that miſtaken place, or the other, agrees not <hi>ex gr.</hi> It is brought as a ſtrong Argument againſt the Doctrine of Chriſt's Suffering for our Sins, that <hi>Matthew,</hi> 8.17. applies that Phraſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4. as quoted by Annotators, to the curing of Diſeaſes. I Anſwer, May be <hi>Matthew</hi> intended
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49060:71"/> not <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4. or at leaſt intended it not alone, but as accompanied with other Prophecies in that Prophet, which did fore-tell theſe healing Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſt. But to make his Proof more full, mentions a place that ſpeaks of the Medicine, as well as the Cure, <hi>for by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Now <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.18. and 35.5. are moſt explicite Predictions of his Curing Diſeaſes. <hi>The weak hands ſtrengthened, the feeble knees confirmed, the blind eyes opened, and deaf ears unſtop'd,</hi> &amp;c. This, ſays the Prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. will be a Salvation, that hath Merit and Reward in it to the Ranſomed Ones; but <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Vengeance on Satan, your Enemy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt Promiſe. But <hi>Matthew</hi> further improves <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecy, for the Medicine as well as the Cure; what this Cure, of Body and Soul coſt Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> no leſs than bearing our Sickneſſes; and that not only as he was a Mortal Man, and ſo the Seed of all Diſeaſes in him, like us in all things, except Sin; but ſuffered in a more violent manner, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>The very Curſe of the Law.</hi> There was no Threatning, ſo no Curſe in the Law or Covenant Mediatorial, 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 2.24. confirms this to be the Senſe, <hi>He bore our Sins in his own Body.</hi> So did He bear our Griefs, and carry our Sorrows, when the <hi>Jews</hi> thought that God afflicted Him for his own Sin.

                     <p>I ſhall conclude this Head with a moſt Emphatick Inſtance of the Points, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24, 25. —30. we have the Story of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> with their Sons, and the Story aſſerted to be Allegorical, or Typical, and the particular place of Scripture quoted by <hi>Paul,</hi> as a Foundation for it, is <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10. <hi>Wherefore ſhe ſaid unto Abraham, caſt out this bond-woman, and her ſon, for the ſon of this bond-woman ſhall not be heir with my ſon, with Iſaac.</hi> The thing Typified is <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Carnal Poſterity, <hi>viz.</hi> not by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but by <hi>Iſaac:</hi> They that through the Grace of the Promiſe Believed in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and through Him were Heirs of Heaven, born from above. But the Queſtion is by what Spectacles <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw this in <hi>Sarah</hi>'s ſeemingly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering Spirit and Expreſſions; he had indeed, the Spirit of Prophecy, but he could not ſee that in a Text, which it did not contain by that Spirit. Now theſe Points informs us, That this Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Myſtery: They Rand thus: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49060:72"/> There is here the greateſt Emphaſis the Points can make, <hi>viz.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Emphaſis is found out, his Office is to diſtinguiſh the Two Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a Verſe, and therefore if there be but one <hi>Verb Indicative,</hi> you muſt repeat him to make two. So <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap> uſe is to compleat a diſtinct Senſe, and if the Words do it not, the Matter contain'd in theſe Words muſt. If <hi>Sarah</hi> had added, <hi>For Fleſh and Blood cannot Inherit the Kingdom:</hi> Or, <hi>No birth by the ſtrength of Nature entitles to Supernatural Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> or any thing of that kind, it makes a compleat Argument. Now we have the Apoſtle's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for it, that this was intended by theſe Words. And Secondly, it is moſt agreeable to the general Uſe of this Point; and I may Challenge any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in an Hiſtorical Book to the contrary.

                        <hi>D. G.</hi> Thinks the whole Intent of this Chapter is to prefer Chriſt to Angels, but not as God; what <hi>Jew</hi> would equal GOD and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel? but as Man, by virture of his Perſonal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, through that Union to God which was nearer than theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, Heb.</hi> 5 5, 8. A <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> by Calling. 2. A <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> by which God glorified Him. 3. A <hi>Son-ſhip,</hi> wherein He learn'd Obedience, and Suffered. 4. A <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> to found a Prieſt-hood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly, Acts</hi> 13.13. This is ſaid to be fulfilled in his Reſurrection. Now 1. His Reſurrection was neceſſary on the account of his <hi>Son-ſhip;</hi> it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his Dignity to be long dead, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Such an holy one</hi> (ver. 35.) <hi>could not feel corruption</hi> I may add, That though his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and firſt Introduction into the World, were not the ſame Day of the Week, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>firſt,</hi> the other the <hi>ſeventh;</hi> yet they agreed in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49060:74"/> his being Foundation of <hi>both,</hi> and in the Solemnity and Significancy of <hi>both;</hi> hence that we have a ſweet Harmony in the Quotations.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A juſt ground for calling the Union betwixt the Humane Nature and Divine Perſonal, or next to Union of Nature; for I believe Angels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it not, ſo nigh it is.</p>
                     <p>There remains yet two more Uſes of theſe <hi>Points.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their <hi>Elentick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> they fit one to be a good Diſputant. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> were not able to ſtand before the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> at the firſt <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe of their Promptitude and Readineſs in <hi>Scripture;</hi> neither is now a <hi>Learned Scholar</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe able to deal with a <hi>Country Farmer,</hi> who is very Converſant in his Bible. I have ſeen a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Arts</hi> (and then my own Maſter) baffled by a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and another by a <hi>Threſher:</hi> And how much leſs is one Ignorant of the Original, able to Diſpute with them that are? for that is the Rule, that is the Canon, that is our Bible. It's rare to find a Verſe where all Tranſlations agree; and what Priviledge can we claim for ours above others, but that it agrees more with the Original, and that he who is Ignorant cannot Judge? I may add, That he who is skilled in the Original, and other Daughters of that Tongue, <hi>Rabbin, Syrian, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean, Arabian,</hi> &amp;c. and wants this part of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> or <hi>Key of Scripture-Senſe,</hi> is not able to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scripture, nor Diſpute from Scripture, on a Divine Subject, with him that is. I have occaſion to experience this, by a Gentleman, whoſe Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in theſe Languages I doubt if <hi>Europe</hi> can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, that is my kind and near Neighbour. How ſoon is a Boy baffled at School, when you tell him he does not Conſtrue right, he does not Parſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49060:74"/> right? He is Silenced, for he is Conſcious that then he cannot make True <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But on the other hand, thou muſt have other Parts of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> as well as this. It were a fooliſh Method to begin a Child with the <hi>Syntactical Part</hi> of <hi>Grammar,</hi> before he can <hi>Conjugate</hi> a <hi>Verb,</hi> or <hi>Decline</hi> a <hi>Noun.</hi> To initiate a Boy with <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> to Teach him the <hi>Logical Analyſis</hi> of <hi>Speeches,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is acquainted with the <hi>Common Style</hi> of the <hi>Language,</hi> or before he knows the <hi>Ingredient Parts</hi> of <hi>Speech.</hi> I ſhall add here, That this doth not only prepare a Student to carry the empty Air of Victory in an <hi>Eriſtick Contention:</hi> As good Skill and Promptitude in <hi>Logick,</hi> will enable a mean Scholar to do from a great Maſter, and Learned Divine. I have known them come off from the <hi>Publick Paleſtria</hi> with <hi>Triumphal Hums,</hi> that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood neither their <hi>Theſis,</hi> nor their <hi>Arguments,</hi> nor the true Uſe of <hi>Logick.</hi> But to Stabliſh and Settle his own Faith, once believing this Book is God's, that his Creator and Governour, who has the Diſpoſal of his Immortal Soul, and Temporal Affairs too, at his Pleaſure, has communicated his Will towards Sinners in this Book, how they may be Happy, notwithſtanding that otherwiſe inſuperable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that lies Latent in a Natural Conſcience; will the God that needs me not? will the God whoſe Patience and Goodneſs I have abuſed; whoſe Talents I have miſimproved; whom I have Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and Contemned every Day I have lived, make me Happy, hugg in his Favour, aſſoon as I have done Breathing? By this thou mayeſt be as much Convinced of the Author's Senſe and Intention in this Book, as its <hi>Divine Characters</hi> (whereof, may be, this is no ſmall part) will Convince thee who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49060:75"/> the Author is, what depth of Wiſdom he had, and what Ocean of Love and Goodneſs, even exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bounty of communicating ſuch a bulky pregnant Entity as Heaven and Earth is, to empty Nothing, exceeding the Wiſdom of ſetting all their Hoſts in order: For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Mutability is the Creatures Eſſential Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Property, attending all its Properties as a Creature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In Moral Creatures, Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a terrible Sanction was the moſt ſuitable Mean to prevent Moral Immutability, from an actual Mutation and Change, into Rebellion and Diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What became the Governing Wiſdom of the Creator of the World to Eſtabliſh as Law-Giver, it became Him as King to Execute.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We will grant a Sovereign Throne of Grace in the Eſſence of the Deity, Superiour to the Tribunal of Juſtice, ſettled among the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and founded on the Laws ſuiting their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability. But if this ſhould be Exerted without moſt deep Repentance, and an univerſal Re-change of their Hearts, their Love, their Faith, and their Obedience to their Creator and Governour; What a contemptible Government and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt we think the firſt was? The Effect of Folly and Weakneſs, more than Wiſdom and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, more than Love and Goodneſs. Repentance is impoſſible to a Man <hi>Spiritually Dead;</hi> it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſame Man to be <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>alive</hi> at once; for God to give this <hi>Spiritual Life,</hi> whoſe Frame of Mind is <hi>Repentance,</hi> is to act contrary to his ſettled Government in the Word. For when the Subject
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49060:75"/> is a Rebel, the Sanction of the Law is Rule to the Diſpenſations of Government, and therefore <hi>Death,</hi> [I mean Spiritual] for Separation of Soul and Body I think was not the Sanction, elſe at the Reſurrection, why ſhould the Wicked be cloathed with their Bodies? muſt be in every Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I therefore conclude, That the giving the Mediator to the World, and the contrivance of his Death as a Satisfaction, [not given to God, as God or Sovereign over the ſettled Tribunal of Juſtice, for as ſuch, and as Creator and Father to his poor made Spirits, He gave Him but as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Judge by the Laws ſettled, for Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Creatures upright, but Mutable] is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the greateſt Wiſdom and Goodneſs that the Heart or Head of Man can take in. Without a Satisfaction to that Government, Sovereignty overthrows it, tramples on it, is contradictory to it. And ſuch the Sovereign Pardoning Power in Governments is not, for its uſed to prevent the Rigour of the Eſtabliſhed Government, its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning it ſelf, and therefore is placed among its Fundamentals as a Preſervative, here it was not, with a Satisfaction, given to the Juſtice in this Eſtabliſhment, the luſtre of the Government ſtill ſhines, and it comes in Subordinate to that other Government, wherein more of God's Glory and Goodneſs appears; its Ruines were neceſſary to this Fabrick, but yet whatever was of God in that Footſtool or Scaffold, is to be preſerved as Sacred, and our Thoughts of it ought to ſuit its Nature, as the beſt Conſtitution for a Mutable Creature, and as moſt fitting to be a Foundation for his Future Structure intended.</p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:49060:76"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reader,</hi> Pardon my going out of my own Road, the Advantage I have found with the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I believe, that <hi>Europe</hi> this Day affords of them that do not reliſh the Doctrine of Chriſt's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, made me throw it in thy way. For to me, as it is the Life of Chriſtianity, and the Beauty and Harmony of it, it is the moſt Commendatory Thing of Chriſtianity, to my Reaſon, of all the Parts I know of it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now return to give Inſtances of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logyſtick,</hi> or <hi>Argumentative <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of theſe Points, for Diſpute, Confirmation, Refutation, Conviction, Direction or Comfort.

The Queſtion is, Whoſe are theſe Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; <hi>The Wonderful Counſelour, The Strong God, The Everlaſting Father;</hi> if the <hi>Caller,</hi> God; or the <hi>Called,</hi> Meſſias, be the Subject of them?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, Hezekias</hi> was not now to be Born, for he was a Man, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.2. &amp; 18.2. nor was the Government on his Shoulders from his Birth; nor was he a Light to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> as this Son was, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> is, <hi>That all theſe Attributes belong to one Subject.</hi> But then they are divided as to the Subject, in Three Kinds.

                  </head>
                  <p>FIRST, the Method of Proceeding is to be obſerved, for it's oppoſite to that of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In <hi>Hebrew</hi> you read from the Right Hand to the Left; but in Parſing by theſe Points, you muſt begin at the Left Hand, for there ſits the greateſt Ruler or Emperor <hi>Silluk,</hi> on whom the reſt depend, according as the Senſe bears Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for all the Points are Relative. Hence a Word

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The purport of the Word, <hi>Train,</hi> or <hi>Dominion,</hi> is to be obſerved, which is a Tract of Words making ſome ſence; and ſubordinated to a diſtinctive Lord, which is more or leſs, mediate, or immediate. For Inſtance, <hi>Sakeph</hi> has a Train of his own, and yet makes up a part of <hi>Silluk,</hi> or <hi>Atnach</hi>'s Train, a Line in the Table is uſually a Train or Dominion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Word <hi>Labore,</hi> to Labour, is uſed, and denotes a Word that has no Syllable, or one only before the <hi>Accent,</hi> which makes one to find the Uſe of the <hi>Hebrew Grammar:</hi> For <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may obſerve, That two or three Words united by <hi>Maccaph,</hi> make but one Word, and one Word is counted two, if another <hi>Accent</hi> be put in place of <hi>Metheg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I Premiſe this, That though the putting the Rules in ſome Compact Order, makes me repeat moſt of the Rules given in <hi>Chap. Second,</hi> yet I need not trouble the <hi>Reader,</hi> nor my ſelf, to repeat the <hi>Axioms,</hi> thither I remit them.</p>

                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:49060:81"/> the diſtinction betwixt the Seat and Uſe of a Lord or Servant. For Inſtance, The Place of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is, where there is a Connexion by ſome Rule of <hi>Syntax.</hi> Now this is where one <hi>Noun</hi> governs another in the <hi>Genitive Caſe,</hi> or agrees with it by Appoſition, or Copulative Particle, or as <hi>Adjective</hi> and <hi>Subſtantive;</hi> or elſe where a <hi>Verb</hi> governs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Infinitive,</hi> or is joyned to another by a <hi>Particle</hi> that may be ſo reſolved; or when it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns a <hi>Noun</hi> behind it, or agrees with one before; and therefore, without Knowledge of theſe, he cannot be ſo diſtinct and accurate in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, though he may receive much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. For he can ſtill think thus; Here is a Miniſter, and therefore this Word is to be united to the following, and what Senſe they make, ſo much Light and Truth I receive.

                  <p>A <hi>Seventh Preliminary</hi> is, Required Skill in the Genius of the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi> eſpecially its <hi>Idiotiſms,</hi> or <hi>Properties.</hi> For Inſtance, in other Tongues, three, four, or five Words, may be Conſtrued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but here it may be ſet among the <hi>Axioms,</hi> that two Miniſters never come together immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in all the Bible; if any ſuch thing appear, one of them is vicarious, in place of a Lord. And this is the Niceneſs and Diſtinction of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as Sacred, <hi>ex gr. Iſa.</hi> 28.24. <hi>Doth he open and break his ground</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for in ſuch Caſes, as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49060:82"/> here the Miniſter is put upon the Third always, to note the like Connexion of all that follows; but a <hi>Minor</hi> on the Second, to ſhow, that though he ſtand next, he comes but in ſharer, or partner in that common Word, in which one already has claimed an Intereſt. The Truth of this is evident, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.6.7.22.9.23, 28.19.22. &amp; 40.1.46.2. <hi>Job</hi> 10.11. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Second Property is, That any ſeparable Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being next the <hi>Verb,</hi> uſually takes a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> as if Conſtrued with it. But more of this may beſpared.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Eighth Prerequiſite</hi> is Skill in <hi>Logick;</hi> for its hard to Parſe by theſe Points, without knowledge of a Propoſition, its Subject, Predicate, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula; its Amphation, and ſeveral kinds. <hi>Ex.</hi> 15.15. <hi>All the Inhabitants of the Land ſhall melt away.</hi>

Jer.</hi> 27.13. <hi>As the Lord hath ſaid againſt the Nation that will not ſerve the King of Babylon,</hi> is but one Propoſition, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap> the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> being diſtinguiſhed as Subject and Predicate. But this Poſition <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> makes two Propoſitions; the one is, <hi>And the Lord ſaid to the Nation:</hi> the other, <hi>The Nation which ſhall not ſerve the King of Babylon.</hi> So that the Author's Intention (whether you ſhould conſider this laſt Propoſition as a diſtinct Subject, or an Enlargement only of the former) is to be learned from the Points, and not Knowledge to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49060:82"/> Govern them by. So when one Propoſition has two Subjects, or two Predicates, we muſt learn whether to make one Propoſition, or two of them by the Points.

But he, P. 67. ſays, It has not ſometimes the Value of half a <hi>Comma,</hi> which he confirms from <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.17. and with Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it, limits his firſt <hi>Axioms</hi> thus: <hi>Every Regale Accent always, and every where, doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; but the ſame Accent, not always with the ſame value; for the Place or Seat of Diſtinction makes great diſparity,</hi> P. 23. It may be I ſhall tell thee News, in Informing thee, that our Tranſlation, though long before him, proceeded from the like Minds, for every Verſe ends not with a Stop or <hi>Punctum. Gen.</hi> 14.1. ends with a <hi>Colon: Numb.</hi> 31.22. ends with a <hi>Comma, Gen.</hi> 23.17. not ſo much as a <hi>Comma.</hi> And in the <hi>New Teſtament, Acts</hi> 1.21.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49060:96"/> ends with a <hi>Comma.</hi> In Anſwer to all this I muſt plead for <hi>Silluk</hi>'s abſoluteneſs: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the number of ſuch places are few; I think the <hi>Maſora</hi> ſays <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſeven:</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.27, 28, 29. <hi>Eſther</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>Num.</hi> 31.22. Suppoſe theſe Seven were truly Seventeen, the Exceptions are not one in a Thouſand, and it would be granted in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the World, that the Exceptions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to prevent a general Rule. But the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Author being urged, and the whole Senſe being his, <hi>Silluk</hi> being a Commander of Senſe, falls under his Providence and Care in a more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner than a Letter or Word. To all which I Anſwer;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Spirit of God is Author of the Faithful Record of what was ſpoken by the Erring Spirit of Man, ſometimes by the Devil himſelf; and what is Recorded as ſpoken by ſuch, is not liable to this urg'd Inconveniency. For Inſtance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.10, 14, 17. the one is the Story of <hi>Ephron,</hi> the other the Story of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the one's Heart is filled with true Sorrow, for the loſs of <hi>Sarah,</hi> the others with <hi>Sympathy,</hi> both acting, as well as expreſſing their Affection: And can Grief be expreſſed without making Pauſes in the midſt of Sentences? We muſt expect there was a Sob or a Sigh where the <hi>Silluk</hi> was placed. And this is what the Author of <hi>Coſri</hi> is ſo large upon. From which I propoſe a General Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> That great Care is to be taken in diſtinguiſhing the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Poſition of a Point, if it be <hi>Reſpectu dicti,</hi> or <hi>Dicentis,</hi> if it flow from the Paſſion of the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or the momentouſneſs of the Matter. Now when God is Author, theſe are not to be parted, except where it is as it were acted, or diſſembled
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49060:96"/> after the manner of Man. Now <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10. Though it is ſpoke by <hi>Sarah</hi> in great Paſſion, yet the Words had an Inrention from the Spirit of God, which made the Senſe compleat. <hi>Caſt out the bond woman and her ſon: All that think or hope to obtain Heaven by their own Works, their natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duements, as</hi> Hagar<hi>'s Fertility or Pains, as her place required, or by being born within the Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving its Initial Signs, as</hi> Iſhmael <hi>did, will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; the Spirit of God commands their Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Here is enough to make up a Compleat Senſe for <hi>Silluk. For the ſon of the bond woman ſhall not be heir with my ſon, with Iſaac.</hi> The Tenor of the <hi>Incorruptible Inheritance,</hi> is the Promiſe of God, from his Sovereign and Free Grace; a Birth not of Blood, nor of Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by the Power of God; when Natures Power entirely fails, by this Title my Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> is Heir.</p>
                     <p>And the like is very probable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.1. It has been of <hi>old,</hi> and is of <hi>late,</hi> the Interpretation of Learned Men, That as <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of Believers, repreſented the Church, whereof <hi>Lot</hi> was a Back-ſliding Part, fallen in Love with the fat Valleys of the Earth, brought leanneſs to his Soul, deſolation to his Family, diſhonour to his Name: Though he had his Soul for a Prey, may be he grew better when rid of his <hi>back-looking Bag of Salt;</hi> as Tart as <hi>Job</hi>'s Meet-help, but much more meet for Satan's Service.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> or <hi>Shem,</hi> Repreſented our Bleſſed Jeſus (if not He) welcoming and bleſſing the <hi>Church</hi> with his viſible Preſence, as their viſible King; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by his inviſible Power, he had aſſiſted them to Triumph over all their Carnal Enemies. Now the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49060:97"/> Analogy of Scripture leads us to a firm Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, That this is at the end, and over the laſt of the Four Monarchies, having then two Witneſſes, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> for the Story its being Typical, its moſt reaſonable to put in the Third, <hi>viz.</hi> The Enemy Triumphed over theſe Four Kings, one is King of <hi>Shinar, Babylon</hi>'s Country, having the ſame relation to the Worldly Empire, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had to the Church.

And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Author of that Verſe is God, and the Figure founded on the momentouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Matter; there is a Sacred Figure, a Type, and that is the Caſe in this Text: So that I add Strength to the Foundation, and diminiſh from the weight of the Roof; ſo that the Structure is more likely to ſtand. The weight which I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, is the determining of the Time, though I could add two Buttreſſes to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That God from this Time begins to hide nothing from him, but by piece-meal, and particular Periods, Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Reveals the Church's various Fates and Lots. From this Victory does he begin; for you ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. The firſt Period of 400 Years is revealed to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it Harmonizes with other Prophetical Periods. But this Opinion does not Harmonize; and yet moſt of theſe Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Gentlemen are againſt Tythes. <hi>R.</hi> 1. Prieſtly Tythes are of a latter date. 2.

                        <hi>ATnah</hi> is the next Abſolute Lord in Power; but generally the Doctrine about him in <hi>Waſmuth, Schnegas, Ledeburius,</hi> is repugnant to his Title Abſolute, and make him as reſpective and dependent, as the leaſt Lord in all the Scheme. It is thus, that 1. Every Verſe requires an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>A <hi>Second Argument</hi> I have againſt it is, That the Degrees of Diſtinction, at this rate, are too Subtle to be comprehended. <hi>Ex gr.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.1.

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though all the Points depend on the Connexion and Diſtinction of the Doctrine or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet the Diſtinctions of Matter are of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and Independant diſtance, where the Lords are call'd Abſolute. I have therefore propoſed Rules of another Nature about them, R. 1. M. 2. R. R. 1.

Let it be here minded, That the variety found on this bottom, flows not from <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> but from that diverſity
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49060:115"/> that is in Vulgar and Common Speech.

And it were a ſuitable Exerciſe for ſome of our great Orators, whoſe Genius is ſo lucky in finding Words of a due Compaſs for Things and Thoughts, and ſo exact in ballancing the weight of every Syllable that renders the Pronounciation Charming, to find out the juſt Laws of Diſtance and Conjunction, in the Chain of <hi>Syntax,</hi> and give to them ſome <hi>Noſcible Characters;</hi> for our four Marks are far from ſufficient, <hi>viz.

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That as we are never to part from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Signification of a Word without neceſſity, ſo we are never to leave the <hi>Grammatical Conſecution,</hi> ſo long as we can apply them.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Grammatical</hi> is the moſt ſimple, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and plain; the other full of curvous turnings and windings, more compounded, uncertain, and difficult; it has been always counted difficult and uncertain arguing from what is Allegorical or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical.</p>

Hence we may learn, that the general Key to the Explication of the Import or Emphaſis of the Figures in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> is to be taken from the Affections, whoſe two great Roots to the Soul, are like Arteries and Veins to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49060:137"/> the Heart the one bringing, the other expelling the Blood, but both equally neceſſary to Life. So Averſion is the Root of Hatred, Fear, Anger, and all Compounded of them. Attraction is of Love, Deſire, Joy, Hope, and all Compounded of them. Among which the greateſt difficulty is in explaining the Paſſions that are Compounded of Averſion and Attraction. So among theſe Points Pauſing, and Feſtination, are eaſily diſcernable, and Degrees of that Kind too. But 1.

                     <p>In the former Punctation there are two Verſes in this Text, in the latter one. I am of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that there are really two Verſes. For, Firſt, What Conſiſtency or Connexion is there between the Number of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons, and this Crime of <hi>Reuben</hi>'s, that they ſhould be put in one Verſe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49060:139"/> The Context is full of diſtinct Verſes, of diſtinct Subjects. Thirdly, This פ is a ſufficient Mark for <hi>Paſuk</hi> the Verſe, or <hi>Soph paſuk</hi> the end of the Verſe. And, Fourthly, <hi>Clode,</hi> and others, ends the Verſe there. Fifthly, This Circle, or <hi>Maſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritick</hi> Mark (whereof there are about 25 in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſignifying ſome Imperfection or Defect in the Senſe) though it ſignifies ſome Defect, yet it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſignifies that the following Verſe ſhould be put in to make it up. Nor indeed does it any Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, that which ſeems deficient is <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Behaviour, What did he? Or, what ſaid he? when he heard this horrible Story. In all probability the Text's deficiency, or ſilence, rather informs us he ſaid nothing, but ſate down amazed; the Groans of his grieved Heart, and the tricklings of his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Tears, were the moſt that Sorrow had left motion in.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve then, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> from hence, That the former Accentuation is the more Regular, and that if there be not a Divine Emphaſis, but the Text has ſuffered, <hi>aliquid humani,</hi> ſome Erring Hand pretending to Correct the latter is the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, eſpecially in the Word <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that the other has been added by ſome Scribe, who thought both Verſes to be in one, פ being put for <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Abbreviation for the Character, for the Second Punctation harmonizes beſt, and only can, with Two Verſes being put in one.</p>
                     <p>To conclude then, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That all is Divine, I muſt ſay with <hi>Varenius,</hi> That in this Punctation there is a double Relation, one to the Senſe with the firſt Punctation, the other to all the reſt of the Verſe with the ſecond Punctation, without which double Conſecution or Dependence, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49060:139"/> for one Propoſition to have two Puncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions regular. So if there be no failure here, as indeed there is no neceſſity of yielding, and to yield without neceſſity, were a greater failure in us. We have the nature of this double Accentuation in the firſt Obſervation, <hi>viz.

                     <p>The Third Branch is of the double Accentuation of the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> There are two conſiderable Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions both depending upon the Points. The Firſt is between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Reformed,</hi> about the Diviſion and Order of the <hi>Commandments.</hi>

                     <p>Obſerve, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Lutherans</hi> make the Two Firſt Commands one, and divide the laſt one into Two. So that the Firſt Precept contains Five Verſes, ſays <hi>Varenius,</hi> it is fundamentally in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; Formerly in the Third; Exegetically in the Fourth, and firſt part of the Fifth; and Syllogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in <hi>Verſe</hi> Five and Six.</p>

                     <p>Obſerve <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as all grant the Number Ten, ſo the Tables to be Two; for though all the Ten are Divine, as to their Original, yet the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is Humane, as to the immediate Object.</p>

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Queſtion is not ſo material as to it ſelf, as to its Conſequences, for under this Cover the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hide their Idolatry, and the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> their Images, becauſe, ſay they, both own only one True God, the Subſtance of the Firſt.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> bring <hi>Paul</hi> Confirming their Opinion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not known luſt, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> preſerve the Uſe and Value of both, but their Uſe is different; the one for the Number of the Commands (in this the <hi>Jews</hi> and we agree) the other for the diviſion of the <hi>Paraſcha's,</hi> and number of their Verſes. <hi>Vide Waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth,</hi> P. 197.
